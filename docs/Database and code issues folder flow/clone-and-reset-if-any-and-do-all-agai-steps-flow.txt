✅ FINAL ANSWER
👉 YES — you CAN remove them
👉 BUT ONLY because we are RESETTING LOCALLY and IGNORING RENDER/NEON FOR NOW

You are not doing anything wrong in this specific situation.

🧠 WHY IT IS OK RIGHT NOW

You said clearly:

❌ Product backend already failed on Render

❌ DB state is messy / broken

❌ We are NOT trusting existing migrations

✅ We want a clean local restart

✅ We will recreate schema properly

So this is a controlled reset, not a mistake.

🔥 WHAT YOU MAY DELETE SAFELY (NOW)
✅ Delete these (LOCAL ONLY)
migrations/
instance/

Why:

migrations/ → broken or experimental history

instance/ → local SQLite / junk configs

🚨 VERY IMPORTANT CONDITIONS (DO NOT IGNORE)
❗ You must ensure ALL of this is true:
| Condition                                | Status |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Product DB in Neon is disposable         | ✅ Yes  |
| Product backend NOT in production        | ✅ Yes  |
| We are rebuilding schema                 | ✅ Yes  |
| No other dev depends on these migrations | ✅ Yes  |

✔ All true → Safe to delete

🚫 WHEN YOU SHOULD NOT DELETE MIGRATIONS (Future Rule)

Never delete migrations/ if:

App is in production

DB already contains real data

Other developers are working

Migrations already applied on Neon/Render

That rule applies later, not now.

🧩 WHAT WE WILL DO AFTER DELETION (NEXT STEPS)

Once you delete:
rm -r migrations
rm -r instance

Then later we will:
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial product schema"
flask db upgrade

✔ Clean
✔ Predictable
✔ Debuggable

🏁 FINAL CONFIRMATION (AS YOU ASKED)

❓ “Can I remove migrations and instance before sharing?”

✅ YES — YOU ARE RIGHT TO DO IT NOW.

This is the correct reset moment.

👉 Go ahead and delete them.
👉 Then share your product backend files.
I’m ready to rebuild it cleanly with you 💪
