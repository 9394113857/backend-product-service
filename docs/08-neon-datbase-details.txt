==========================================

🧨 STEP 1 — Clear Alembic history (VERY IMPORTANT)

At the neondb=> prompt, run this ONE command:

DELETE FROM alembic_version;

Expected output

Something like:

DELETE 1


or

DELETE 0


(both are OK)

🚪 STEP 2 — Exit psql
\q


You should be back to PowerShell.

🧱 STEP 3 — Stamp base (now it WILL work)
flask db stamp base

Expected (no error):
Context impl PostgresqlImpl.

🚀 STEP 4 — Apply migrations to Neon
flask db upgrade

Expected:
Running upgrade -> 78b16d25cfb6, init product table with angular fields


✅ This creates the products table in Neon with:

name

price

description

image

category

color

created_at

🔍 STEP 5 — Verify (optional but good)
flask db current


Expected:

78b16d25cfb6 (head)
